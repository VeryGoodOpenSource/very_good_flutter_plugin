## Getting Started 🚀

**❗ In order to start using Very Good Flutter Plugin you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your machine.**

### Running the Example ⚙️

The `src` directory contains the main `my_plugin` package along with the platform interface and the platform-specific implementations.

You can run the example via:

```sh
cd src/my_plugin/example
flutter run
```

The plugin supports the following platforms:

- ✅ Android
- ✅ iOS
- ✅ Linux
- ✅ MacOS
- ✅ Web
- ✅ Windows

### Generating a Custom Plugin 📦

The Very Good Flutter Plugin template is available through an independent [mason][mason_link] brick or via the [Very Good CLI][very_good_cli_link].

If you have not previously installed Very Good CLI, you can install it via:

### Very Good CLI usage

Very Good CLI usage docs are available [here][cli_docs_usage].

### Using the brick directly

1. Install [mason][mason_link]

   `dart pub global activate mason_cli`

2. Add the brick

   `mason add -g very_good_flutter_plugin`

3. Make a new Very Good Flutter Plugin

   `mason make very_good_flutter_plugin`

## Testing 🧪

Very Good Flutter Plugin ships with 100% code coverage. To learn more about why we believe 100% code coverage is important and other testing best practices [read our guide to Flutter testing][very_good_testing_blog_link].

### Running Tests 🧑‍🔬

Each platform implementation includes tests which can be run via:

```sh
flutter test
```

## Continuous Integration 🤖

Very Good Flutter Plugin comes with a built-in [GitHub Actions workflow][github_actions_link] but you can also add your preferred CI/CD solution.

Out of the box, on each pull request and push, the CI `formats`, `lints`, and `tests` the code using [Very Good Workflows][very_good_workflows_link]. This ensures the code remains consistent and behaves correctly as you add functionality or make changes. The project uses [Very Good Analysis][very_good_analysis_link] for a strict set of analysis options used by our team. Code coverage is enforced using the [Very Good Coverage GitHub Action][very_good_coverage_link].

In addition, there are E2E tests as part of the `my_plugin` workflow to ensure that the plugin correctly integrates with the host application on each platform.
